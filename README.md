## About the Project

**Updated Portfolio** is Homework 8 for UW Coding Bootcamp. We were instructed to update our responsive portfolio that was created for Homework 2.  
I included substantive updates to this assignment by replacing the lorem ipsum text and dummy images with information about me and images and links of my deployed homework assignments. I also finished by replacing the default Bootstrap styling with my own aesthetic. I also cleaned up my file structure to make it more in line with best practices.
